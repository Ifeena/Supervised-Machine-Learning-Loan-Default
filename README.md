# MACHINEL LEARNING MODEL BUILDING FOR LOAN DEFAULTERS

# OBJECTIVE:
Buliding a Model using Machine Learning (Supervised - as the data is a labeled) to help predict loan defaulters.

# CODE FLOW
1. Import Packages
2. Load Dataset
-  Statistical Analysis of Dataset
-  Descriptive Analysis of Dataset
3. Data Cleaning
-  Check for missing values and outliers and treat accordingly
4. Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA
-  Numerical Features
   - Univariate Analysis
   - Bi/Multivariate Analysis
-  Categorical Features
   - Univariate Analysis
   - Biltivariate Analysis
5. Feature Engineering/Data Pre-processing
-  Creating a copy of the dataset
   - Assign a variable for the Train Set
   - Assign a variable for the Test Set
-  Encoding Categorical Features
   - Use LabelEncoder (.fit_transform) to learn and convert the categorical features into numerical values
6. Model Building - Supervised Machine Learning
-  Data splitting
-  Model Building using only ML Algorithm classifier (Logistic Regression only)
-  Improve Model Performance by applying Feature Scaling to treat outliers and normalize the data
-  Improve Model Performance by assigning class weight to treat class inbalance
-  Deploying Various Machine Learning (ML) Algorithm Classifiers
-  Feature Importance and Feature Selection
-  Automating the Process of Model Tuning (Hyperparameter Tuning) - Selecting the Best Classifiers (parameters) to Train Model
